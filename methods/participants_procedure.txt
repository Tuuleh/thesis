PARTICIPANTS
The participants were a total of 278 League of Legends-players. A total of 218 players were considered for this study, as the rest were under level 30 or reportedly did not engage in ranked games. The final pool of participants ranged between ages 45 and 15 (M = 21.42, SD = 4.15).
The players were mostly from the Western EU (N=17) and North America (N=113) regions, with a minority of players from EU-North and East (N=17), Latin America (N=5), New Zealand (N=7) and Turkey (N=2).
206 of the participants engaged in ranked games in the solo bracket, 51 played 5-versus-5 games, and 18 3-versus-3 games. Out of the team players, 47 also played in the solo bracket.

PROCEDURE


ANALYSES

Assumedly due to motivational factors, many of the praticipants had partially invalid data. I calculated response times and rates of accuracy for all of the cognitive tasks, and excluded cases where the proportion of accurate responses was below 0.6. I also excluded cases where response times were inadequately short (under 200 milliseconds), or inadequately long (depending on the task - four seconds for the Flanker task, ten seconds for the mental rotation task and twenty seconds for the Tower of London), as this implied that the participant was idle during the experiment. This left quite a few of missing values in the data set.

I decided to conduct some dimension reduction to reduce the number of predicting variables for the cognitive tasks. A scree splot inspection revealed that an acceptable solution could have between two and five principal components, so I tested orthogonal, oblique and unrotated models with a different number of components. As even the components on the oblique solutions were nearly uncorrelated, I chose a four-component model with Varimax rotation due to its interpretability. Because many of the participants had partially incomplete data from the clean-up process and due to the large number of predictive variables, the number of participants would have fallen extremely short if only perfectly complete cases were considered, I performed imputation by replacing missing values on the cognitive tasks with medians, before carrying on with the principal component analysis.
