Problem with the questionnaires: not sufficiently discriminative
Non-significant, or even negative correlations arise from the fact that everyone was prone to evaluate their team in a very positive light.
-Could also be due to self-selective sample (I recruited with a message that stated I was looking for ranked players and their teams to participate in research -> more attractive for players with a positive experience with their team)
-Self-selective nature of teams themselves (if you don't like your team, it takes relatively little effort to find a new one)
-Sampling time - at the end of the season: players have found teams they're happy with


Surprising: the lack of association between cognitive functions and performance in solo games. 
- I anticipated there'd be a clearer association between cognitive functions and performance in solo games, than in team games, and that in team games, team cohesion would also have a significant effect
- It turns out that there is more of an effect of cognitive functions in team games than in solo games, but I think this is due to a few factors of the game culture:
    - The players do not play alone in solo games. Coordination in the team is still important, despite the lack of contact and familiarity between the team members, which does not necessarily mean that the role of cognitive skills would be highlighted, but rather, highlights the ability to communicate and coordinate clearly in an environment that doesn't facilitate efficient communication.
    - Players who play only solo games are a very different group from players, who queue both in teams and solo. The first population represents a much more casual bunch than the second population, and this is reflected between how cognitive skills relate to performance in players who only play solo games, and players who play solo games on top of their team-based games.


18 3v3 teams and 51 5v5 teams
- 3v3 teams are more rare, and when asked, many players reported using them as a fall-back for when 5v5 games were not an option.
    - consequently, results for the 5v5 teams are likely more reliable
