    a) video games lend themselves to research:
        - easy-to-acquire teams for team cognition research
        - intrinsically motivated experts in their native niche
        - 'expertness' and 'level of performance' are already quantified
        - easily accessible samples for web-based experiments
    b) sports for sports psychology, e-sports for e-sports psychology
        - professional gamers train several hours a day, attend competitions similar to athletes, and despite of the component of psychomotor strength and stamina associated with sports, they can benefit from techniques similar to those used in sport psychology. The obvious differences between the tasks and performance between e-sports and normal sports only justify the necessity of researching e-sports individually, as an addition to traditional sports psychology.


Video games lend themselves to research for several good reasons. One of them is that they offer relatively easy-to-recruit teams for research on team cognition. Much of team cognition research in the past has arguably been done on groups, rather than teams [CITATION], as teams in their functional context can be difficult to reach and recruit. Team-based video games, on the other hand, provide researchers with expert teams that are often intrinsically motivated by research participation. Additionally, PC game players who participate in web-based experiments are actually participating on the same platform and tools that they use in their team work. Since many team-based games contain different ranking systems - such as that for PvP performance in League of Legends - the level of performance of players participating in these games is already quantified and represented by their ranking. Additionally, in many games, a leveling or tier system allows for controlling the experience, or 'expertness', of the players.
With the active e-sports community, competitive video games should also be a subject of psychology similar to traditional athletics. Professional gamers train several hours a day, attend competitions similar to athletes, and despite of the diminished role of psychomotor strength and stamina associated with sports, they have a need for stamina and throughput in other strenuous mental activity (such as prolonged durations of intense vigilance and swift strategic decision-making) and can benefit from techniques similar to those used in sport psychology. The obvious differences between the tasks and performance between e-sports and normal sports only justify the necessity of researching e-sports individually, as an addition to traditional sports psychology.
