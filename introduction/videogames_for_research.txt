    a) video games lend themselves to research:
        - easy-to-acquire teams for team cognition research
        - intrinsically motivated experts in their native niche
        - 'expertness' and 'level of performance' are already quantified
        - easily accessible samples for web-based experiments
    b) sports for sports psychology, e-sports for e-sports psychology
        - professional gamers train several hours a day, attend competitions similar to athletes, and despite of the component of psychomotor strength and stamina associated with sports, they can benefit from techniques similar to those used in sport psychology. The obvious differences between the tasks and performance between e-sports and normal sports only justify the necessity of researching e-sports individually, as an addition to traditional sports psychology.


Video games lend themselves to research for several good reasons.

Teams are a special type of a group - a "distinguishable set of two or more people who interact dynamically, interdependently, and adaptively toward a common and valued goal, object or mission, who have each been assigned specific roles or functions to perform, and who have a limited life span of membership", (Salas, Dickinson, Converse & Tannenbaum, 1992, p. 4). Because genuine teams can be relatively difficult to come by and recruit for research on team cognition, research on computer supported cooperative work and social psychology arenas on small group behavior and decision making tend to be done on groups, not teams (Cooke, Gorman & Winner, 2006). Video game teams can offer a large pool of accessible, genuine teams for research on both areas, and additionally, can come with different levels of "teamedness" that can be used for statistical control. For instance, in League of Legends, players can queue for ranked games in three different ways: alone or with one friend, to be paired up with random players of similar skill to form a team of five players; in a pre-made team of three players, who all know each other and queued together; or in a similar premade team of five players. Team-based video games can provide researchers with expert teams that are often intrinsically motivated by research participation. Additionally, PC game players who participate in computerized experiments are actually participating on the same platform and tools that they use when collaborating with their team. Since many team-based games contain different ranking systems - such as that for player-versus-player (pvp) performance in League of Legends - the level of performance of players participating in these games is already quantified and represented by their pvp ranking or rating. Additionally, in many games, a leveling or tier system allows for controlling the level of the players' experience in the particular game, and different games offer additional performance measures that can be used as additional performance measures. In the case of League of Legends, this could be e.g. resources gathered in game, the average proportion of own deaths in game compared to the number of enemies slain, and so on.

With the active e-sports community, competitive video games should also be a subject of psychology similar to traditional athletics. Professional gamers train several hours a day, attend competitions similar to athletes, and despite of the diminished role of psychomotor strength and stamina associated with sports, they have a need for stamina and throughput in other strenuous mental activity (such as prolonged durations of intense vigilance and swift strategic decision-making) and can benefit from techniques similar to those used in sport psychology. The obvious differences between the tasks and performance between e-sports and normal sports only justify the necessity of researching e-sports individually, as an addition to traditional sports psychology.
