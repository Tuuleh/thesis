Problems in existing research:
- sample sizes in prior research are small
- unclear cut-off points between novice vs. expert players
- fuzzy differences between video game genres, experts recruited from a number of different genres
- gender differences in novice vs. expert player split (e.g. Boot et al. (2008) - all experts and novices male, all controls female)
- if your research problem involves 1,5 hours of participation, perhaps your effect sizes are not sufficiently sizeable to be worth reporting
- assessing gender differences under results that are dictated by the availability of sample sizes under situational factors 




When it comes to studying cognitive skills and video game play, there is quite a large body of literature looking into video game training effects on different cognitive abilities (e.g. Maillot, Perrot and Hartley (2012); Feng, Spence and Pratt (2007); Guha, Jereen. DeGutis & Wilmer (2014); Best (2012); Green & Bavelier (2003); Green & Bavelier (2007)), and comparisons between expert and novice players as well as between players and non-players (e.g. Anderson, Bailey and West (2012); Boot, Framer, Simons, Fabiani and Gratton (2008); Dye, Green and Bavelier (2009), Green & Bavelier (2003); Green & Bavelier (2007); Colzato, van Leeuwen, van den Wildenberg and Hommel (2010); Karle, Watter and Shedden (2010)). 

There is much less literature on player performance. Some research on exists on how a team's behavior during game play relates to performance. For example, Drachen et al. (2014) researched different ways in which the spatio-temporal behavior -- the tendency of the players within a team to move around on the game area as a response to events that were taking place in game -- varies across teams with different levels of skill. They discovered that spatio-temporal behavior of teams in a MOBA called DotA2 is highly related to the team's skill level both in terms of changing position around the terrain, and in the distance between the characters played by the team members. 
Pobiedina, Neidhardt, Calatrava Moreno and Werthner (2013) used data from DotA2 and its community to discover that the factors influencing a team's success (ranked by significance) were the number of team members that identified as each other's friends -- the social ties within the team; the team's "hero score" -- how well the chosen heroes performed when it came to their win-loss ratio or the amount of resources they could gather in game; and the team's experience score as an aggregate measure of experience of the team members.

Much less research exists on whether and how cognitive skills contribute to performance across different skill tiers. It is meaningful to look at contributions of cognitive skills because they bridge between behavioral factors in game - e.g. the spatio-temporal functions described by Drachen et al. (2014) - and the social factors identified as significant by Pobiedina et al. (2013). It makes sense to assume that social processes within the team and the players' cognitive skills are what drive the performance on a behavioral level. 

Studies in cognitive skills and player performance are also useful to guide decisions on which instruments to use, and which cognitive skills to focus on in video game training studies. Difference in a cognitive skills between players of different performance ratings implies that that particular skill is relevant for gameplay in that particular game or genre. Once such a skill is identified, its use is meaningful in video game training studies, where researchers can then establish, whether playing the game improves that particular skill, or if performance differences occur due to underlying differences in cognitive skills irrespective of gameplay.
Additionally, cognitive skills that are manifested at a different level between players of different performance ratings can be used in training studies.
The role of cognitive skills in player performance should also researched because cognition is what governs the entire gameplay itself, and simply because there is a dire gap for such research.
