- instrument not 100% comparable to previous research
- unstandardised instruments
- only one game
- web-experiments (accuracy)
- server in San Francisco
- questionable blinding
- very self-selective sample
-'candy' between the experiments -> influence motivation (response was very positive)
- limited duration of individual tasks increases alpha error probability, but was necessary to keep participant number high

Due to the game:
- it was difficult to recruit from all the regions
- decay: ratings vary also due to inactivity, not due to player performance
- the season was just about to come into end -> this could have been a good or a bad thing:
    - more active pvp players, but ratings might not be representative of the team's typical rating throughout the season
    - limited time for sampling
