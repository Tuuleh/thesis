Intention of the current study:
- see how cognitive skills and team cohesion work together to predict team performance
    Implications for:
        - psychology in e-sports
        - game design
            - if performance appears unrelated to cognitive skills, other processes need more exploration

- identify cognitive skills relevant to gameplay in MOBAs
    Implications for:
        - defining instrumentation for training studies
- add to the relatively modest body of academic literature on MOBAs

The intention of this study was to observe how cognitive skills and team cohesion together work to predict team performance and task load in League of Legends. The findings have implications for MOBA e-sports as well as for game design.

The intention was also to identify some of the cognitive skills relevant to gameplay in MOBAs. This would have implications for guiding selection of relevant skills and instruments for training studies.

Finally, my intention was also to contribute to the relatively modest body of academic literature on MOBAs. A vast community of millions of active players and culture of its own should be subject to academic curiosity.

An additional goal was to get experience using JavaScript-based web-experiments and assessing, whether the data gained from them is good for the purpose of a research like this.
